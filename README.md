Rock, paper, scissors is a hand game that involves two players simultaneously making one of three hand gestures to represent rock, paper, or scissors.

Rock beats scissors 
Scissors beats paper 
Paper beats rock 

If both players make the same gesture, it's a tie and play continues until there's a winner. The game can also be used to select someone to do a task, with the person whose gesture wins being chosen.

Rock, paper, scissors is a zero-sum game, meaning one player wins and the other loses. It can be a fun way to pass the time and can also help improve critical thinking and communication skills. The earliest version of the game originated in China, then spread to Japan, where it took its modern form, and eventually to the rest of the world in the early 20th century. 
The game has remained relatively unchanged over time, with the same rules used wherever it's played.
